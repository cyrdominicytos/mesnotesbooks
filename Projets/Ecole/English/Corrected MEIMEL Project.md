**Methodology** 

For the MEIMEL project, I teamed up with Amilcar, who has a keen interest in vocabulary and listening, while I focused more on speaking and listening skills.

Our approach, or NUDGE, involved sending SMS reminders with humorous content on interesting topics, particularly technical subjects that we were passionate about. For instance, in December, I shared a video on how to integrate an SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) into a project for security purposes, and we exchanged similar content as much as possible. Additionally, Amilcar recently sent me a video from a YouTuber parodying the development scene in Canada.

To further enhance our English proficiency, we incorporated activities we enjoy where we exclusively spoke English. For example, we went to the gym together at least three times a week, and we really respect that planning in December and January. Additionally, we played football every 2 weekends. Another significant activity was our participation in an IT Hackathon at Sopra Steria company in December, which was an amazing experience from which we learned a lot.

Furthermore, we decided to be partners in all our projects and conducted our work discussions solely in English. This approach significantly facilitated more natural conversations.

**Results** 
After two months, we can now have a global view of what we learned with this new way to improve our English. Personally Iâ€™m proud of my progress. I can now have informal and technical consersation  with everybody in  English. I can also, understand a large part of the discussions.

**Conclusion**

While I know that my improvement in writing and reading has been limited, I am confident that I am on the right way  to achieve my main goal of attaining fluency in English and acquiring a native accent. Therefore, we intend to continue with our gym and football routines, as we both enjoy them. Additionally, I plan to travel to London after my internship for further immersion in the language.
