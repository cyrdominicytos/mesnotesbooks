Cyriaque was more interested in Speaking and Listening , Amilcar was more interested in Vocabulary and Listening. **The NUDGE :** sending messages by SMS as a funny reminders with an interesting topics about the other would like to watch. For example: Amilcar sending a video of a youtuber about a parody of what is being developer in Canada. **Other activities done in English :** going out to play football every 2 weekends in which we spoke only in english. Speaking in english during working time (we were partners for almost all projects), by teams and face to face.

We also have at most as possible some qualities times together, for example we go usually to play football and in that moment we communicate  in English. One interesting moment that we also have is an Hackathon that we participate in December, it was an amazing experience  and we learned a lot



**Methodology**
For the MEIMEL project, I decided to work with Amlicar who is more interested in vocabulary and listening but me I was more focus on speaking and listening.  

First of all, our NUDGE was to send SMS as funny reminders with an interesting topics specially technical subjects which really passionate us. For example, in december, i sent a video about how to integrate an SBOM (Software Bill Of Materials) in a project for security perpose and we shared many other similar content as more as possible. In the same contexte, Amilcar send  me  recently a video of a youtuber about a parody of what is being developer in Canada.

In the same idea, to practice better english and improve ourselves, we added some activities that we love to practice in which we spoke only in english. For example, we go to the gynasm together at least 3 times pear week and we really respect that planning in December and January. Also, we go to play football every 2 weekends it was. One other interesting moment that we also have is an IT Hackathon that we participate in December at Sopra Steria company, it was an amazing experience  and we learned a lot.

Our last idea was to be partners in all projects and when working we spoke only in english. It was very hepfull to make conversations coming more naturally.

**Results**
After two month, we can now have a global view of what we learned with this new way to improve our English. Personally I’m proud of my progress, I can now have informal or technical consersation  with everybody in  English. I can also, understand a large part of the conversations.

Conclusion

I have to admit I did not improve my level in writing or written comprehension. But for my main goal which is to become totally fluent in english and have the native accent, I think that i'm on the good way. So we still plan to continue with the gynasm and football (we really love that) and I'm planning to travel to London after my internship for more inmersion.
